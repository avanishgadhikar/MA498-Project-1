# 📘 Modelling and Analysis of Microstructure of Electronic Exchanges

This repository contains the code, data, and report for my thesis titled  
**“Modelling and Analysis of Microstructure of Electronic Exchanges.”**

The project aims to understand how **modern electronic exchanges** operate, explore the **microstructural dynamics** that drive market behavior, and simulate **order book dynamics** using models established in financial market literature.

## 🧭 Overview

Electronic exchanges form the backbone of modern financial markets.  
This project investigates:

- The **functioning** of electronic exchanges  
- The **principles and mechanisms** driving order book dynamics  
- How these dynamics influence **price formation** and **liquidity**  
- Simulation of such exchanges using **Zero-Intelligence Models (ZIMs)**  

By combining insights from **market microstructure theory** and **agent-based simulation**, this work provides a quantitative understanding of how simple rules at the order level can give rise to complex market phenomena.
